# Super Market Billing Project

This is a simple billing system created in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The main goal of this project is to simulate a basic checkout process for a supermarket. Users can add products, enter quantities and prices, view totals with tax, and save receipts with timestamps.

## Project Overview

The project allows users to:

- Add multiple items to a bill
- Automatically calculate totals and taxes
- Generate and save receipts in `.txt` format
- View detailed summaries of each transaction

This project is a good example of how Python can be used to build a basic, text-based point-of-sale (POS) application. It's especially useful for students or anyone learning Python and wanting to apply it to real-world use cases.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Built-in Python libraries like `datetime` and `os`
